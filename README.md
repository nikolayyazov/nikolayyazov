- 👋 Hi, I’m Nikolay Yazov
- 👀 I’m interested in Python coding in a moment, maybe Java later. Also - software testing, maybe more than coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python coding
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... dunno
- 📫 How to reach me ... I think there is some way here, on GitHub, to send a message, but I don't know exactly yet.
